      C_CALLS_F90 <br> C Main Program Calls FORTRAN90 Subroutines
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>C_CALLS_F90</b>
      is a directory of C programs which
      illustrates how a C main program can call a FORTRAN90 subroutine.
    </p>

    <p>
      For this example, the KRONROD package is used.  Note that the KRONROD
      library is available in C and in FORTRAN90, so this example is not
      created out of necessity (the C main program could have simply called
      the C version of KRONROD).  Instead, it is intended as an example of
      how to do this when you have to (you don't have a C version of the
      routines you want to use.)
    </p>

    <p>
      When calling a FORTRAN90 routine from a C function, there are
      some simple things that may be enough to guarantee success.
      <ul>
        <li>
          a FORTRAN90 subroutine is like a C void function, and should
          be declared this way in the C code.  The qualifier <b>extern</b>
          should also be used.
        </li>
        <li>
          a FORTRAN90 subroutine or function expects all its arguments
          to be passed by reference.  This generally means simply that
          the C function must pass scalar variables by reference, not value.
        </li>
        <li>
          typically, when the FORTRAN90 compiler compiles the FORTRAN90
          code, the names of functions and subroutines are stored with
          an appended underscore.  In order for these names to be found
          by the C code, it is necessary that the C code declare and
          invoke the FORTRAN90 functions and subroutines with the underscore
          explicitly appended to the name.
        </li>
        <li>
          in many cases, a FORTRAN90 compiler is simply a "front end" to a
          corresponding C compiler, as in the case of the GNU compilers
          gfortran and gcc, or the Intel compilers ifort and icc.  This means
          that, as long as the corresponding compilers are used to compile
          the FORTRAN90 and C codes, it is probably possible to use either
          compiler to link and load the object codes; however, the load
          command may need to specify explicitly certain libraries associated
          with one of the languages.  For instance, if loading using the
          gcc command, it is necessary to include "-l gfortran" so that
          the FORTRAN90 I/O libraries, among others, are included in the build.
        </li>
      </ul>
